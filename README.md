This is a project I built during my Software Development bootcamp with Just IT, January 2025 - February 2025.

It is an ecommerce website focused on Calisthenics gym equipment and clothing.

Calisthenics is a form of resistance training that mainly involves using your own bodyweight e.g. pull-ups and push-ups and is something I regularly practise myself.

I really enjoyed being able to creatively express a personal interest of mine through Software Development.

In this project, I incorporated everything I had previously learned through the HTML & CSS course I completed prior to the bootcamp including:

- Nested div elements
- Grid layout
- Flexbox navigation bar

What went well:

- Built a working website from scratch (navigable between pages)
- Well presented having written 600+ lines of CSS
- Confirmed my ability to take knowledge learned and apply it independently

Areas for improvement:

- Didn't apply responsive design principles using media queries
- Used fixed sizing in px as opposed to responsive alternatives in % or rem
- Didn't any functionality using JavaScript

Following on from this project having identified areas for improvement, I realised the importance of building user friendly websites/applications. Both pleasing to the eye, responsive to different screen sizes and not prone to human error.

My focus now is to apply these principles to future projects and learn JavaScript to apply dynamism and functionality to websites/apps.
